# To-do

Priority Matrix Todo is a web-based task management application that allows users to organize and prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance. Users can add tasks, categorize them, and assign them to a priority quadrant based on the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent & Important, Important but Not Urgent, Urgent but Not Important, Not Urgent & Not Important).

## Features

- **Categorization**: Users can categorize tasks (e.g., Personal, Work, Fitness, Shopping).
- **Eisenhower Matrix**: Tasks are organized into quadrants based on urgency and importance to help prioritize effectively.
- **Sorting Options**: Tasks can be sorted by date (newest or oldest), priority, or task name.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed for accessibility on various devices.
- **Task Persistence**: Tasks are saved in local storage for persistence across sessions.
